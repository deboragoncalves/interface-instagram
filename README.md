# interface-login-instagram

### This project was done during the Bootcamp of the DIO (Digital Inovation One), in Gabriela Pinheiro's class about CSS (Flexbox). The main objective was to reproduce the Instagram layout.

### In addiction to the subject that was ministrated by Gabriela, I also added the responsive menu in the footer, as in the lnstagram original layout.

## Steps to run the project

### 1. Clone the project

git clone git@github.com:deboragoncalves/interface-login-instagram.git

### 2. Open in your browser the file named by "index.html".
