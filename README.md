# Interface Login Instagram

This project was done during the Bootcamp of the DIO (Digital Inovation One), in Gabriela Pinheiro's class about CSS (Flexbox). The goal was to reproduce the Instagram layout.

In addiction to the subject that was ministrated by Gabriela, I also added the responsive menu in the footer, as is in the lnstagram original layout, and some hover effects.

## Steps to run the project

### 1. Clone the project

    git clone git@github.com:deboragoncalves/interface-login-instagram.git

### 2. Open in your browser the file named by "index.html".
